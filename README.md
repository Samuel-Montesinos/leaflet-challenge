Learning to use leaflet for UCI coding bootcamp

I used the Leaflet documentation from https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#map-methods-for-layers-and-controls to work through this. I also used GeoDev's youtube playlist "Leaflet from basic to advance" located at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyWyQBSWLw1NH1wsA0wkSMTlQ45P0AqCj.
